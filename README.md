## Q&A

**Q**: I can't install the extension because it says "Not Compatible" on Chrome Web Store?

1. At the top right, click the 3 vertical dots.
2. Click Help -> About Google Chrome.
3. Wait for Chrome to download update.
4. Relaunch Chrome.

**Q**: What does "Session expired or invalid"/"INVALID_SESSION_ID" mean?

**A**: This is because your session has timed out and you've been logged out of Salesforce. Close all Salesforce Niknax windows, log back into Salesforce and try again.
